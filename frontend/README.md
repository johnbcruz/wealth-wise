# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was set up using Create React App.

## Available Scripts

When you're in the project directory, here's what you can do:

### `npm start`

This command runs your app for you to see while you're developing it. When you use this, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your app. When you change something in your code, the app will automatically update so you can see the changes. If there's a mistake in your code, it might show you some error messages.

### `npm test`

This lets you test your app. It will keep looking for changes and run tests every time you update your code.

### `npm run build`

When you're ready, this command prepares your app for the real world. It makes sure everything is put together in the best way for people to use. After running this, you'll have a `build` folder which has everything you need to put your app online.

### `npm run eject`

Just a heads up: Once you use this, you can't undo it!

If you want more control over how your app is put together, you can use this command. It will take out some of the automatic settings and give you all the files to manage yourself.
